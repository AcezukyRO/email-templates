Please get on the Cutting Edge release stream (you will find the setting in the Options panel in-game) and attempt to replicate the issue. If the issue can still be replicated, play around with the Debug settings found at the bottom of the Options panel and attempt to isolate a cause for the issue; performance issues are most common with slider rendering.

If you are using an Nvidia graphics card go into your graphics card driver settings and disable "Threaded optimization" as seen here: http://puu.sh/pkaZq/668420e567.jpg, restart your computer and see if the issue remains.

Close any programs you have running to try and isolate the cause further. Possible culprits are f.lux or Razer Synapse; however we ask that you close all programs that are not necessary to run osu! for better chances of isolating the issue.

Try going into Compatibility Mode (again, the setting is in the Options), and see if the issue can be replicated.

Some users have reported that the Norton antivirus also causes stuttering lag - try exiting it before playing the game.

Finally, if none of those worked, try to replicate the issue without Compatibility Mode and all Debug settings disabled and [send us the runtime.log and performance.log files](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Help_Center#how-do-i-provide-log-files-when-asked) found in the Logs folder in your osu! installation directory.
