- Make sure that you are typing your username, not your e-mail address, to log in to the client
- Make sure that you've typed your password correctly. If you're unsure what your password is, you can [reset it on this page](https://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot).
- Make sure you are not using any proxies or VPNs while trying to connect to the game.

If none of these resolved the issue, we'll need you to [provide us a network.log file](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Help_Center#what-are-'log-files'-and-how-do-i-make-them?) for us to investigate.

You can find these troubleshooting steps any time [in this article](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Help_Center#what-is-this-'bancho-authentication-error'-i-keep-on-receiving?).
