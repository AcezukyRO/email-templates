Make sure that you are not using any proxies or VPNs while trying to connect to the game. Disabling them might fix the issue.

If you aren't, please get on the Cutting Edge release stream (you will find the setting for this in the Options) and let osu! run for a while to replicate the problem a few times, then [send us the network.log file](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Help_Center#how-do-i-provide-log-files-when-asked) found in the Logs folder in your osu! installation directory.
