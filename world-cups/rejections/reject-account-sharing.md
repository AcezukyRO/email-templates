Hello,

We are sorry to say that we cannot accept your registration to participate in this year's world cup due to your breaches of our game rules in the past 12 months - in your case, accessing and playing on other user's accounts.

This is not a permanent ban from official tournaments, and if you maintain good behaviour from now on, you will be allowed to apply for next year's World Cup. You may want to read the [community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Rules) to get a clear picture of what we expect from players who wish to participate in official tournaments.
