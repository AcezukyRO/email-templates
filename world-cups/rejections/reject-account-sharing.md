Hello,

We are unable to accept your registration for the upcoming world cup tournament due to the following reason:

**Your account has been identified either creating or using several other accounts to access the game.**

If you feel this judgment was made in error, you may reply to this response with a request for more details or attempt to explain your situation. If you choose to do this, please do so as soon as possible, as we are on a limited timeframe and cannot investigate rejection appeals forever before the tournament starts.

This is not a permanent ban from official tournaments, and if you maintain good behaviour from now on, you will be allowed to apply for next year's World Cup. 

You may want to read the [community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Rules) to get a clear picture of what we expect from players who wish to participate in official tournaments.
