Hello,

We are sorry to say that we cannot accept your registration to participate in this year's world cup because you have been granted an appeal within the past 12 months. We require that players demonstrate good behaviour for at least a year after successfully appealing before we consider their participation in official tournaments.

This is not a permanent ban from official tournaments, and if comply by the rules, you will be allowed to apply for next year's World Cup. You may want to read the [community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Rules) to get a clear picture of what we expect from players who wish to participate in the future.
