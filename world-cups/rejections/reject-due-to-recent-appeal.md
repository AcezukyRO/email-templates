Hello,

We are unable to accept your registration for the upcoming world cup tournament due to the following reason:

**You are still disallowed from participating in official tournaments due to the conditions of a recent ban appeal.**

If you are unsure of when you may resume play in official tournaments, feel free to ask and we'll reply with the appropriate date.

This is not a permanent ban from official tournaments, and if comply by the rules, you will be allowed to apply for next year's World Cup. 

You may want to read the [community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Rules) to get a clear picture of what we expect from players who wish to participate in the future.
