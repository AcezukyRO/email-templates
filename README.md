'Canned responses' used by the osu! support team to help supplement and accelerate response times

Requirements
--------------

- People skills and problem solving
- Native or near-native level written English

Contributing
-------------

All contributions are welcomed. Contributions may be made via pull requests to this repository - any proposed changes will be reviewed by the support team and discussed both publicly and privately before being approved.

We are not currently looking for translations at this time, but we may be in the future.

Expectations
-------------

All proposed changes must be:

* Clear, concise and in 'simple English'
* As accurate as possible
* Supply valid references to included information where appropriate
    - For example, a response centered around tournament tickets must include a link to a specific wiki article or post from an osu!team member detailing the change
