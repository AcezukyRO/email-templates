The restriction was placed due to chargeback(s) being placed by an email address associated with your account. We do not tolerate chargebacks.

As per all restrictions, any accounts you may attempt to make will be placed under a similar state. While we normally enforce a 3-month cooldown period after restricting an account, you may appeal your restriction anytime for this case. If you attempt to evade by creating or accessing another account, the cooldown will normally be applied instead.

You may resolve this by reimbursing the costs incurred as a result of your action. Please let us know if you wish to appeal and we will provide further details.
