Your account has been found engaging in excessive multi-accounting despite previous warnings and has been permanently restricted as a result.

As per our [Community Rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Rules), using or owning multiple accounts is strictly forbidden. You may appeal your restriction after waiting a cooldown of **3 months** from today. Attempting to evade the restriction will result in this cooldown being extended at our discretion, up to a point where we will simply ignore your appeals if your evasions are too numerous.

You are free to play on your main account, but playing on any of your multi-accounts, even restricted, will count as evading.
