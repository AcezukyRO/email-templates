Your account has been found to be in breach of our community rules regarding multiple accounts creation and sharing. Owning or using multiple accounts are not allowed - each osu! member may only have *one* account associated with them. It is also forbidden to play on someone else's account or have someone else play on yours.

Your original account likely remains accessible. Please use the first account that you ever created to play, and do not create any additional multi-accounts or share your account with anyone in the future. Avoid accessing any of your other accounts, as that would still be a breach of our rules and might lead to further sanctions.
