Hello,

We've received your appeal and queued it. We will treat it as soon as possible - our current response time hovers between two and three weeks.

You will receive a reply to this e-mail address with our response, whether your appeal is granted or denied, or if we require further information from you (in the case your appeal is incomplete).

Please make sure you do not play on any accounts you have that are not the one you are appealing for, as that constitutes a breach of our core rules and will result in your appeal being denied.

If you want to add something to this appeal, please send a new mail to accounts@ppy.sh with what you want to add, and we'll update your current appeal. Do not send a new one - we close older appeals upon receiving new ones and our response will be pushed back if you do.
