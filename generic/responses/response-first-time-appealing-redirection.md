If it is your first time attempting to appeal, please use the google form linked by clicking on the red banner on the website. If you can't login to your account for any reason then please use [this link](https://docs.google.com/a/ppy.sh/forms/d/1PtDknLzpXKSg4uJVgVxAAfFTpDjCnTDRlRkVHxkts8A/viewform)

If this isn't your first appeal, or you've already used the form in the past, please send an e-mail to accounts@ppy.sh containing your full appeal (follow the questions given in the form).

We expect users to give us a full, honest history of their actions in their appeal, as well as reasons why we should allow them and how we can ensure they won't repeat their misbehaviour.

Appeals can take some time to be treated, but are never ignored.
