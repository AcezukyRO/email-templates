You can reset your account's password on [this page](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot). Using this recovery form requires being logged out.

If you are already logged in and are trying to change your password because you forgot your previous one, the page will redirect you to the password change page in the Settings. In this case, we recommend using a browser different from your usual one, so that you do not lose access to your account but are able to reset its password.
