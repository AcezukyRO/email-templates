Sorry, but we do not currently delete accounts unless certain prerequisites are met (as per [your rights and control](https://osu.ppy.sh/legal/privacy#your-rights-and-control)). If you wish to disable access to your own account, you may change your password to a random string of letters and numbers in your [account settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/account/edit).
