Sorry, but we do not currently delete accounts unless certain prerequisites are met (as per https://osu.ppy.sh/legal/privacy#your-rights-and-control). If you wish to disable access to your own account, you may change your password to a random string of letters and numbers in your [profile settings](https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/ucp.php?i=profile&mode=reg_details).
