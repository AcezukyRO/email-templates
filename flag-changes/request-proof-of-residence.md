We'll need to see proof that you are from the country that you are requesting a nationality change to.

What we consider to be acceptable proof is as following:
A photograph of your ID (such as your driver's license, passport, citizenship document, or any form of ID that is acceptable in your home country) along with your account logged in to the client (**not** the website) in the same picture.

You may feel free to blank out any personal or sensitive data; as long as your username and country of residence are visible in the image.
